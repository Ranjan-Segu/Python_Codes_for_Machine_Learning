# Python_Codes_for_Machine_Learning
This repository contains python codes the are used for machine learning and has been divided by libraries and also the files that were created during practice. 
Spyder interface was used for coding.

1. Basic_Functions (Basics of python coding like variable assignment, calculations, types, conversions, lists)
2. Numpy_Functions (Used for scientific computing like creating, modifying, calculating, types, conversaions of arrays)
3. Pandas_Functions (Built on numpy library provids easy to use data structures such as data frames and data analyis for programming)
4. Scikit_Learn_Functions (Contains codes for core machine learning activites such as preprocessing, validation and algorithms)
5. Matplotlib_Function (2D plotting library used to plot and create visuals like charts and graphs and configure and customize them)
